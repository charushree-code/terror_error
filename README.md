Terrorism has stricken fear in the hearts of many people across states and nations. To predict future patterns and gain past insights, in this project we aim to analyse the GTD dataset for various terrorist attacks and try to incorporate meaningful inferences from it along with bringing new novel patterns and relations undiscovered till now using various machine learning models like  random forest classifier,bagging,k-NN 


steps we took in getting our predictions:
