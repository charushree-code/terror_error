Terrorism has stricken fear in the hearts of many people across states and nations. To predict future patterns and gain past insights, in this project we aim to analyse the GTD dataset for various terrorist attacks and try to incorporate meaningful inferences from it along with bringing new novel patterns and relations undiscovered till now using various machine learning models like  random forest classifier,bagging,k-NN 


steps we took in getting our predictions:
  data cleaning,eda,model making,predictions
data cleaning invovles  filling null values dropping irrelevant columns and rows if values are too sparse.

problem statement we work on
1.Given an attack, figure out the attack type. 
models built are random forest, knn, bagging. random forest gave better accuracy of 0.88.
2.For an attack made by a specific group, estimate the amount of property and human damage caused by the event.
random forest which gave accuracy of 0.94.
